What are Large Language Models?
Alarge language model is a type of computational model designed for natural language processing tasks such as language generation. As language models, LLMs acquire these abilities by learning statistical relationships from vast amounts of text during a self-supervised and semi-supervised training process.
In simpler terms, an LLM is a computer program that has been fed enough examples to be able to recognize and interpret human language or other types of complex data. Many LLMs are trained on data that has been gathered from the Internet — thousands or millions of gigabytes' worth of text.But the quality of the samples impacts how well LLMs will learn natural language, so an LLM's programmers may use a more curated data set.


Architecture of LLM
Large Language Model’s (LLM) architecture is determined by a number of factors, like the objective of the specific model design, the available computational resources, and the kind of language processing tasks that are to be carried out by the LLM. The general architecture of LLM consists of many layers such as the feed forward layers, embedding layers, attention layers. A text which is embedded inside is collaborated together to generate predictions.




 
How do Large Language Models work?
Large Language Models (LLMs) operate on the principles of deep learning, leveraging neural network architectures to process and understand human languages.
These models, are trained on vast datasets using self-supervised learning techniques. The core of their functionality lies in the intricate patterns and relationships they learn from diverse language data during training. LLMs consist of multiple layers, including feedforward layers, embedding layers, and attention layers. They employ attention mechanisms, like self-attention, to weigh the importance of different tokens in a sequence, allowing the model to capture dependencies and relationships.
